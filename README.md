# Team 4 Genetics Project

### Aim
Simulate population genetics.

The first version of the project is to simulate a basic version of the
Wright Fisher model. This consists of having random alleles that have the same
probability of integrating the next generation. The simulation is a model of the
Genetic drift within a population.

The next part of the simulation is to have a more selective allele repartition
and a consideration of additional factors (migration, mutations, selection) that
will create a more realistic simulation of population genetics.

More to come!
