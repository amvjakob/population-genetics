#GENERAL PARAMETERS:

# Execution mode: vars are
# 0 - none
# 1 - mutation
# 2 - migration
# 4 - selection
# 8 - variable population size
MODE = 2

# Number of generations _ to the time of the simulation
GEN = 100

# Number of replicas _ corresponds to the number of executed simulations
REP = 5

# Marker Sites _ loci corresponding to the alleles (sequence of nucleotides)
SITES = 1|2|1



#MIGRATION PARAMETERS : to pick a model uncomment the line by deleting the # key

# Migration patterns: Exchange of individuals amongst sub population
# 0 - completeGraph _ every sub population exchange with one another
# 1 - star _ every sub population exchanges with the central population
# 2 - ring _ every sub population exchanges with their neighbours
# MIG_MODEL = 2

# Migration rate are chosen from: vars are
# 0 - userInput
# 1 - random
# MIG_MODE = 1

# For the userInput mode: Migration rates (incoming|outgoing) for each subpopulation:
# MIG_RATES = 3|5



#BOTTLENECK PARAMETERS

# Bottleneck execution mode:
#Reduction _ reduction size factor
#Start _ start time of the bottleneck effect
#End _ end time of the bottleneck effect
REDUCTION = 2.0
START = 20
END = 40



#MUTATION PARAMETERS : to pick a model uncomment the line by deleting the # key

# Mutation probabilities for marker sites _ when running the simulation with the
# Mutation parameters, the line needs to be uncommented
# MUT = 1E-7|1E-7|1E-7

# Mutation model (Cantor model is chosen by default if no other model is picked)
# the Felsenstein model works if the sum of all the rates need to be equal to 1
# MUT_KIMURA = 0.5
# MUT_FELSENSTEIN = 0.25|0.25|0.2|0.3




#SELECTION PARAMETERS: to pick a model uncomment the line by deleting the # key

# Selection rates for each allele 
# SEL = 0|0
